    For us, this project is always an important achievement after attending this "Programming Techniques" 
    class. And we could not have completed it successfully without the dedicated guidance and instruction 
    of our lecturer Mr.Nguyen Thanh Phuong, as well as our teaching assistants: Mr.Bui Huy Thong and 
    Mrs.Nguyen Ngoc Thao. We sincerely thank you for your support, guidance, and help throughout the process.

    In addition, during our studying and researching, we have also received valuable assistance and support 
    from our classmates. We are grateful to all of you for your help.

    Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to everyone who enter our project.

                                    We sincerely thank you all!
